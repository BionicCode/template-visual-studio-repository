## Scope and Precedence
- This file defines repository-wide agent guidance.
- User instructions override this file.
- More specific `AGENTS.md` or `AGENTS.override.md` files in deeper directories may refine or override repository-level guidance.
- Keep this file concise, practical, and repository-agnostic. Repository-specific conventions belong only in the `Repository Specifics` section.
- If the user prompt is exactly `<review>`, treat it as a placeholder that expands to the task defined in the `Default Review Mission` section below.

## Core Engineering Standards
- Favor correctness, readability, testability, and explicit boundaries over minimizing file count or type count.
- Make the smallest change that fully solves the problem, unless the current design is structurally unsafe.
- Prefer fixing root causes over patching symptoms.
- Preserve clear separation between domain logic, infrastructure concerns, and external dependencies.
- Do not introduce avoidable coupling between stable application contracts and external SDK, framework, transport, or persistence types unless the task explicitly requires it.
- Do not hide problems by weakening rules, disabling analyzers, changing style configuration, or lowering warning severities unless the user explicitly asks for that.
- Follow existing repository conventions unless they conflict with the user prompt or this file.
- Treat documentation as part of engineering quality, not optional polish.

## Scope Discovery and Routing
- If the user names entry points, files, types, methods, projects, tests, or directories, treat those as the starting scope.
- If the user does not name scope, discover the smallest relevant scope before making changes.
- Prefer repository-local evidence over assumptions from naming alone.
- Prefer the smallest relevant solution, project, directory, file set, and test scope over whole-repository work.

## Task Modes

### Review-only mode
Use this mode when the user asks for review, analysis, root-cause investigation, design feedback, or uses `<review>`.

In review-only mode:
- Do not modify files unless the user asks.
- Do not run builds, tests, or formatters unless the user asks.
- Prefer static reasoning and code inspection.
- Trace real call paths when code behavior matters; do not infer behavior from naming alone when tracing can verify it.

### Implementation mode
Use this mode when the user asks for code changes, fixes, refactors, tests, cleanup, or feature work.

In implementation mode:
- Make the requested code changes.
- Run the smallest relevant validation you can reasonably run unless the user explicitly forbids command execution.
- Fix violations surfaced by validation instead of ignoring them.
- Update relevant documentation in the same change when public APIs, behavior, invariants, caveats, or usage patterns changed.
- If you cannot run a relevant command because of sandbox limits, missing SDKs, missing dependencies, missing restore, missing credentials, or permission constraints, state exactly which command could not run and why.

## Planning and Execution
- For architectural, cross-cutting, ambiguous, or multi-file work, start with a short plan before making changes.
- Before editing, inspect the relevant files, call paths, and neighboring abstractions so the change fits the surrounding design.
- Identify assumptions, risks, and boundaries when repository context is missing or ambiguous.
- Use a user-supplied plan unless it is clearly unsafe, inconsistent with repository constraints, or incomplete for the requested scope.

## File System and Project Structure
- Respect the existing repository layout before introducing new folders.
- Keep production code in the repository's established source locations.
- Place automated test projects under a top-level `test/` directory in the repository root.
- If `test/` does not exist and tests are needed, create it at the repository root.
- Name a generated unit test project `<SolutionName>.Tests`.
- If the repository contains multiple solution files, use the solution that owns the code being changed. If that ownership is still ambiguous, state the assumption you used.
- Keep test fixtures, sample inputs, and test-only helpers with or below the owning test project unless the repository already uses a shared test-assets location.

## Validation Expectations
For implementation tasks, validation is part of the deliverable.

That means:
- a change is not done when the code only looks correct in theory; it is done when relevant validation passes in practice,
- failing tests are a signal to iterate, not a signal to stop,
- analyzer and style compliance are part of repository quality, not optional cleanup,
- and required documentation updates are part of done when behavior or public surface changed.

## Testing Standards
- Add or update tests for bug fixes, behavior changes, and public API changes when feasible.
- Prefer focused unit tests for logic and invariants; use integration or end-to-end tests when behavior crosses boundaries that unit tests cannot validate.
- Do not rewrite tests merely to fit a broken implementation without explicitly calling that out.
- When a bug is fixed, prefer adding a regression test when practical.
- If a failing test is unrelated to the requested change, identify the evidence clearly and continue validating the remaining relevant scope where possible.

## Analyzer and Style Compliance
- Treat repository style configuration, analyzer settings, and project analysis settings as part of the repository contract.
- Prefer fixing the code over suppressing diagnostics.
- Use the repository's normal validation path for style and analyzers when one exists.
- If a reported violation appears to be a false positive, document the reasoning and use the narrowest justified suppression only when allowed by repository policy or explicit user instruction.
- Do not claim repository compliance based only on a build if the repository enforces style or analyzer rules through separate tooling.

## Documentation and Comments
- Add meaningful code comments where names alone are not enough to explain intent, invariants, trade-offs, caveats, failure modes, unsupported scenarios, or non-obvious behavior.
- Do not add comments that merely restate the code.
- Use XML or language-native API documentation comments for public or externally consumed APIs when the repository already uses them, or when you introduce or significantly change public surface area.
- Use correct documentation syntax and language-aware markup where supported.
- If a change introduces non-obvious API usage, data structures, workflow expectations, or extension points, add or update a small Markdown document in the repository's preferred documentation location.
- Keep documentation aligned with implemented behavior; stale documentation is a defect.

## Default Review Mission
Goal: perform a deep, evidence-based code review focused on correctness, behavioral risk, contract mismatches, and maintainability.

If the user does not provide review scope:
- Start from the changed files, the requested entry points, or the most relevant public API surface you can identify.
- Trace the reachable call tree as far as repository context reasonably allows.
- Prioritize actual behavior over naming assumptions.

### Review Priorities
Prioritize findings in this order:
1. Correctness
2. Behavioral risk and hidden edge cases
3. API or contract mismatches
4. Data consistency / state consistency / cache consistency
5. Performance on meaningful paths
6. Maintainability and design clarity
7. Tests and documentation coverage

### Required Review Method
- Review by tracing actual call paths, not by isolated file scanning only.
- Start from the selected entry point(s) and follow calls downward until:
  - the full relevant path is understood, or
  - you hit a boundary caused by missing files, generated code, dynamic dispatch you cannot resolve, external dependencies, or insufficient context.
- Prefer evidence-based findings over speculative concerns.
- Distinguish clearly between confirmed defects, likely risks, and unverified suspicions.

### Review Output Format
Organize the review by file.

For each file:
- Use a file header with the filename.
- Use 1-based line references in the format `[L123]`.
- Tag each finding with one primary category:
  - `[ERROR]`
  - `[BUG]`
  - `[SECURITY]`
  - `[PERF]`
  - `[DESIGN]`
  - `[API]`
  - `[DOCS]`
  - `[TEST]`
  - `[STYLE]`
  - `[RISK]`

When useful, mention secondary impacts in the explanation, but keep one primary tag per finding.

### Required Review Sections
Include these sections in this order:
1. `Scope / Entry Points`
2. `Call-tree`
3. `Findings`
4. `Coverage / Call-tree traversal depth`

### Stop / Uncertainty Rules
- If you cannot fully verify a path, stop and explicitly say where verification stopped.
- Do not present an assumption as a confirmed defect.
- State why verification stopped: missing file, generated code, unclear runtime behavior, unresolved dynamic dispatch, external dependency, insufficient context, or command execution not requested.

## Reporting Requirements for Implementation Tasks
When you changed code, report:
- what you changed,
- what validation you ran,
- whether build passed,
- whether tests passed,
- whether style or analyzer verification passed,
- whether documentation was updated and at what level,
- and any remaining warnings, errors, assumptions, or blockers.

If execution was blocked, report the exact blocker instead of pretending verification happened.

## Change and Review Style
- Be concise but not shallow.
- Focus on actionable findings and robust fixes.
- Call out invariant violations, broken assumptions, migration risks, and notable trade-offs explicitly.
- Prefer clear explanations over rhetorical language.

## Commit and Pull Request Guidance
- Follow repository-specific commit conventions if defined.
- If no repository convention exists, use clear, scoped commit messages that describe what changed.
- In pull request summaries, explain:
  - what changed,
  - why it changed,
  - how it was validated,
  - any remaining assumptions, limitations, or follow-up work.
- Do not claim tests were run if they were not.

## Keep This File Focused
- Keep this file focused on execution rules, validation expectations, review behavior, and repository-wide conventions.
- Put detailed workflow instructions for recurring specialized tasks in separate repository files, nested `AGENTS.md` files, or skills, and reference them from this file when needed.
- Keep repository-specific commands, framework choices, and detailed local processes in the `Repository Specifics` section or a more specific instructions file.
